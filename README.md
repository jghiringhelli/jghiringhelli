# Hi, I'm JC

I build developer tools that make AI coding assistants smarter.

## Projects

### [CodeSeeker](https://github.com/jghiringhelli/codeseeker)
Graph-powered code intelligence for AI assistants. Builds a knowledge graph of your codebase so Claude, Copilot, and Cursor understand how your code actually connects.

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jghiringhelli/codeseeker/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

### [ForgeCraft](https://github.com/jghiringhelli/forgecraft-mcp)
MCP server that generates production-grade engineering standards (SOLID, testing, architecture, CI/CD) for AI coding assistants, tailored to your stack. Supports Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, and Aider.
